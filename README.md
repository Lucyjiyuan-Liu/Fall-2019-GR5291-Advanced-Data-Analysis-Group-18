**Project summary:** 

  Our project is to create a movie recommender system. We separate our users into two groups, new users and existing users, and utilize different techniques to make movie recommendations. For new user just signing up, we offer a quick survey to obtain some knowledge on the usersâ€™ taste. For existing users, after their logging in, we can retrieve their rating history. Therefore, we use collaborative filtering to recommend movies they may like, which are supposed to be similar to their taste based on their rating history. We researched several methodologies, including factorization algorithms, regularization terms, and post processing to figure out the optimal methods for our movie recommender system.
